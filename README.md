# To-Do List  
A simple task manager built with **HTML**, **SCSS**, and **JavaScript** — add, complete, and delete tasks with data saved locally.
# Introduction
This is a small web application that helps you organize your daily tasks.
You can **add**, **mark as completed**, or **delete tasks** — and everything is automatically saved in your browser’s localStorage, so your to-do list stays intact even after reloading the page.  
This project was created as a practice project to strengthen skills in front-end development, DOM manipulation, and SCSS styling.
